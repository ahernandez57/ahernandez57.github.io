## About Me

I am an undergraduate student in Civil Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  
My interests include *data analytics*, and `Python programming`, as well as applying engineering principles to solve real-world challeneges. I am passionate about data-driven approaches to improve infrastructure, transportation systems, and community resilience. 

I enjoy working in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn new tools and technologies that can enhance my engineering projects. Outside of academics, I have a strong interest in sustainability, innovation, and using engineering to make a positive impact on society.

## Projects

### Project 1: Automation of Concrete Mix Design

This project focused on automating the Nebraska Department of Transportation’s (NDOT) concrete mix design process, which was originally handled in Excel. Using Python, we created functions to replicate the Excel calculations, allowing users to input different material amounts and properties to generate a mix design weight chart for 1 cubic yard of concrete. We used tools and libraries such as pandas for data handling, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, and openpyxl for working with Excel files. The outcome was a Python-based tool that runs four different concrete mix designs and compares them using clear, informative graphs.

### Project 2: Sensitivity Analysis of FEMA National Risk Index

This project examined potential bias in FEMA’s National Risk Index (NRI) by performing a sensitivity analysis comparing the NRI’s official risk scores with an independently developed alternative risk definition. The goal was to determine whether different definitions of risk lead to different conclusions about which communities are most vulnerable to natural disasters, which has important implications for disaster preparedness and funding. Using Python, we cleaned and merged large public datasets (including NRI and Social Vulnerability Index data), applied visualization tools, and analyzed how changes in risk definitions impacted the results. Through this work, I learned how to handle complex datasets, build clear visual comparisons, and critically evaluate how data analysis decisions can introduce bias and shape real-world outcomes.
